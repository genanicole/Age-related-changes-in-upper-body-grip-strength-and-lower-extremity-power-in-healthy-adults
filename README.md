In this study I investigated age-related changes in upper body grip strength and lower extremity power among healthy adults aged 18–70. My primary objectives were to assess differences across age bands, identify the peak ages for strength and power, and evaluate how well age predicts these physical attributes. To support this, I recoded the age variable into distinct bands and computed an age-squared variable, ensuring the model could capture both linear and curvilinear trends.

The analysis involved five hypothesis tests—two group comparisons, two curvilinear regressions, and one correlation—each carried out with comprehensive assumption checks to validate the approach. Findings confirmed statistically significant variations between age bands, with strength and power peaking in early adulthood before declining, as captured through curvilinear models.

Results are presented in APA-styled tables and figures, providing clear, visually supported insights into the relationship between aging and physical performance. The curvilinear model especially highlights the accelerated decline in strength and power with advancing age, reflecting the nuances of age-related changes in physical capability.
