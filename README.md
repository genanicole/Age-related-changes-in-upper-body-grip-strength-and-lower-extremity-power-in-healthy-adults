# Age-related changes in upper body grip strength and lower extremity power in healthy adults
The client’s study focused on the age-related changes in upper body grip strength and lower extremity power in healthy adults aged 18-70 years. Client needed to test for differences in strength and power between the age bands, as well as finding out at what age does strength and power significantly decline from their peak values. Additionally, they wanted to find out how much age predicts strength and power, and check to see if there is a correlation between age and power.

I have recoded variable 'Agedec' into 'Age_bands' and labelled into its categories (mandatory for the comparison analysis). I have computed variable 'Age_squared' (mandatory for curvilinear regression). I have performed 5 hypothesis testing (additional testing included assumption verification before actual testing) which included 2 comparisons, 2 curvilinear regression and 1 correlation. 

I have also provided statistical interpretation of results and academic reporting. I have included a peak point in both regression scatterplots, as per client’s specific request, after calculating them using formula. As the results concluded, all of them confirmed as being good fit for the models of the design, and all of them were valid.

All of the tables and figures were generated, formatted, named and labeled using APA Style.
